    "intro1": "I'm a Software Developer from Singapore, currently based in Seoul, South Korea.",
    "intro2": "Since graduating from the National University of Singapore's School of Computing in 2011, I've worked 4 years in Singapore ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ - developing Facebook games, mobile apps for both Android and iOS, and educational Flash games; and 6 years in Seoul ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· - developing Unity mobile games on both Client and Server side.",
    "intro3": "This site was created for the purpose of having some fun with web programming while learning to use Angular.",
    "reason_title": "3 reasons why I chose to live in South Korea",
    "reason_intro": "Whenever I get on the topic of how long I've lived in Korea (7 years), people are always curious as to why I decided to leave Singapore. \"Isn't Singapore better?\" Well, here are some of my reasons.",
    "reason1": "Weather - it's hot and humid all year round in Singapore, basically 4 seasons of summer. Even though I dislike the extremes of both summer and winter here, I think I dislike sweating more than freezing. Also, having the cooling and beautiful spring and autumn seasons is just the cherry on top.",
    "reason2": "Language & Culture - I love the Korean language. I think it's a genius invention which made Hanja easier to write and the language easier to learn, while also differentiating itself from the other Asian languages. (Thank you King Sejong for inventing Hangeul.) The Hallyu Wave has swept me along with the high production value and awesome visuals that K-dramas and K-pop offer.",
    "reason3": "Convenience - Abundance of convenience stores, cheap and fast food and package delivery services,  well-established and timely public transport system are just some of the advantages I enjoy while living here. Even traveling out of the city is convenient with KTX, express buses and rental cars very easily available.",
